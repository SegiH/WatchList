# WatchList
WatchList is a multi-user app that lets you track the movies and TV shows that you watch.

You can use this app to track how many times you watched something, where you watched it and when you watched it. You can also rate movies or shows and get recommendations based on the movie or show you are looking at.

After adding information for a while, WatchList will generate statistics to show you trends for favorite movies and tv shows and more.

It is possible to add a WatchList record by searching IMDB if you provide an API key. More info is available in INSTALL.md.

WatchList uses a JSON database to store your logged movie and TV shows.

WatchList can be run as a web app. If you use Google Chrome or Edge, you can also install WatchList as a desktop application by installing it as a [Progressive Web Application](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) (PWA) where it runs on a desktop or mobile device and looks like a native desktop application. See INSTALL.MD for details.

Docker is also supported. See INSTALL.MD for details.
